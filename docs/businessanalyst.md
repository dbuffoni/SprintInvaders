The Scrum Board (Dialogue Zone)

Characters pop up at the bottom to taunt you before their wave begins. This is where the irony and humor hit hard.
Let' s start from the Business Analyst: 

1. I've analyzed the requirements, and we need to add just one more feature!"
Consequence: 1 new Scope Blocks of size XXL suddenly drops onto the screen, increasing the player's workload. 
2. I need to validate this with the stakeholders. Can you hold on a second?"
Consequence: The player’s weapon locks for 8 seconds.
3. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this further."
Consequence: The game shifts into a "meeting mode," where the player navigates a dialogue tree to escape. It’s a time-wasting detour, but scope block are not frozen.
