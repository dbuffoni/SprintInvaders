# Sprint Invaders: Code or Explode


## Overview

**Title:** Sprint Invaders: Code or Explode\
**Genre:** Retro pixel-art space shooter\
**Theme:** A developer’s desperate fight to deliver sprint scope against creeping chaos and workplace shenanigans.\
**Core Mechanic:** Shoot down slow-moving "Scope Blocks" (the sprint’s core deliverables) before they reach the bottom of the screen. Advanced enemies—Scope Creep, Product Owners, Bugs, and more—spawn to disrupt your focus, block your shots, or crowd the screen, while the Scrum Master and the CTO tries to help but typically fails.\
**Visual Style:** 8-bit pixel art with a glitchy, neon-drenched vibe—think *Space Invaders* meets a *Jira* nightmare.

## Story

You’re **Dev-1**, a pixelated coder piloting a laptop-shaped ship, armed with "code commits" to blast through sprint deliverables. Each level is a 2-week sprint, and your goal is to clear the **Scope Blocks** before they crash into your "delivery zone" at the bottom. But beware:

- **Product Owners** expand the scope,
- **Scope Creep** grows out of control,
- **Bugs** clog the screen, and
- **Service Managers** block your shots.

The Scrum Board at the bottom dishes out sarcastic dialogue from your foes. Can you ship it, or will the sprint bury you?

## The Scrum Board (Dialogue Zone)

Characters pop up at the bottom to taunt you before their wave begins. This is where the irony and humor hit hard.
Let' s start from the Business Analyst: 

- **Product Owner:** "Oh, you cleared that ticket? Here’s 5 more—surprise!"
- **CEO:** "Double the scope, half the time—chop chop!"
- **Service Manager:** "Prod’s on fire, but your sprint’s cute, I guess."

## Enemies & Behaviors

### Scope Blocks (Basic Enemies)

- Slow-moving, non-reactive bricks representing the sprint’s core deliverables.
- Move downward in orderly rows, like *Space Invaders* aliens.
- **Pixel Art:** Pixelated Jira tickets with titles like "US-123: Login Button."
- **Behavior:** If they reach the bottom, you lose a coffee cup—scope undelivered!

### Scope Creep (Growing Threat)

- Starts as a small Scope Block but **grows bigger and tougher** as the Product Owner adds requirements.
- Takes more shots to destroy the larger it gets.
- **Dialogue:** "Wait, it needs a dark mode… and a chatbot… and a dancing cat!"
- **Pixel Art:** A Scope Block that sprouts extra limbs and text like +FEATURE.

### Product Owner (Scope Expander)

- Spawns mid-level, firing "requirement rays" that turn Scope Blocks into Scope Creep.
- **Dialogue:** "The client just loves my 2 a.m. epiphany—implement it!"
- **Pixel Art:** A smug suit with a pixelated coffee mug and a backlog clipboard.

### Bugs (Crowd Chaos)

- Tiny, erratic enemies that swarm the screen, making it hard to aim at Scope Blocks.
- Spawn after you destroy a Scope Block (because every fix breaks something).
- **Dialogue:** "Whoops, forgot to test that edge case!"
- **Pixel Art:** Glitchy red beetles with 404 on their backs.

### Service Manager (Shot Blocker)

- Drops big, bouncing "urgent tickets" that block your shots and obscure Scope Blocks.
- **Dialogue:** "Prod’s down—your sprint can wait, right?"
- **Pixel Art:** A headset-wearing UFO with a blinking "P1" label.

### CEO (Sprint Accelerator)

- Rare boss that speeds up all Scope Blocks and Scope Creep.
- **Dialogue:** "My bonus rides on this—move it, code monkey!"
- **Pixel Art:** A tie-clad spaceship spitting dollar-sign exhaust.

### Salesperson (Distraction Swarm)

- Drops "promise drones" that zigzag across the screen, distracting you from Scope Blocks.
- **Dialogue:** "Sold a quantum AI feature—good luck, champ!"
- **Pixel Art:** Briefcase drones with slick grins.
